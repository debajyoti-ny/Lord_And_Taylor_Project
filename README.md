This project is based on Lord and Taylor website. The project is built with a Hybrid Framework -- BDD with Page Object Model (MVC design pattern). It has about 101 cucumber scenarios/test cases. As of May 17, 2018, all the scenarios are working completely fine (i.e. Tests are passing successfully).
